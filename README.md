# My Recipe application

This is a simple React and Spring Boot application for learning experience only. The app will evolve over time with more features when the time allows. Right now it is a simple management application where you can register recipies and rate them on a five star rating.

The modules are:
* recipe-management-web (React frontend)
* recipe-management-service (Spring Boot backend)
